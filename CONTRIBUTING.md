# Contributiing
This document details norms and procedures for contributing to the project.
Before contributing, please read through this document. By contributing, you
agree to the rules and standards written below.

## Team Standards
### Team Values
- As a team we are friendly, helpful, and considerate towards one another, and
    do not assume ill intent on the part of our team members.
- As a team we strive to work together to solve the problems set out before us.
- Any questions and concerns should be voiced either during team meetings or in
    the team Discord channel, so that they can be addressed quickly and
    properly. Team members should strive to respond to messages directed at them
    within 24-48 hours.
- When there is a disagreement, the team will discuss (not necessarily all at
    once) until a unanimous consensus has been reached.
- If a member of the team fails to perform their responsibilities to the needs
    of the team, the other team members can discuss and bring it to the
    attention of the professor and grader through the team Discord channel.

### Sprint Guidelines
- Sprints should last approximately two weeks, beginning and ending on a class
    day. Each sprint will have 2-3 standups. Standup due dates are listed on the
    course syllabus, and will be coordinated by the team prior. Members are
    expected to be present for any and all meetings and standups unless
    necessary. Team members who have not made progress on their assigned tasks
    for multiple standups will be considered neglectful of their
    responsibilities and subject to relevant team rules.

### Development Guidelines
- Team members are expected to use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to standardize 
    formatting of code.
- All code must be peer-reviewed and tested before being merged into the `main`
    branch.
- Team members should adhere to the following guidelines when writing code:
    - Write just enough code to get things working, and then refine afterwards.
    - Always push working code.
    - Make small commits, limited to a single feature or fix.
    - Provide a descriptive commit message with present-tense ("Fixes ..."
        instead of "Fixed ..." etc.).
    - Use descriptive variable and function names that make it easy to
        understand what the code is doing.
    - Do not retain code that is not being used.
    - Write automated tests for critical integration points and functionality.

## Contribution Guidelines
### Contribution Workflow
Team members should fork the organization repository. Each feature or fix should
be added to a new branch. When code is ready to be merged into the organization
repository, team members should create a pull request that describes the purpose
of the PR and any related issues/tasks. Once the PR has been reviewed and 
tested, it can be merged into the same branch on the upstream repository and
subsequently its `main` branch.

### Contribution Rules
Before contributing, if there is not already an issue describing the
task/problem addressed by your contribution, please create one. Refer to the
workflow rules above for how to create a pull request.
